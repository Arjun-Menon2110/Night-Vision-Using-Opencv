This project uses **OpenCV** and **NumPy** to simulate a night vision effect in real-time using your webcam.  
It enhances low-light video feed by applying contrast adjustments, a green tint, and displaying a **light intensity meter**.

## 📌 Features
- **Night Vision Effect** – Adds a green filter for a realistic night vision feel.
- **Real-time Light Intensity Meter** – Displays the current brightness of the frame.
- **Automatic Contrast Enhancement** – Uses histogram equalization for better visibility.
- **High Brightness Warning** – Alerts when the environment is too bright.
- **Live Webcam Feed** – Works with your default webcam.
